# Decision tree

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is widely used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or a class label.

The decision tree algorithm learns by recursively splitting the dataset based on the values of different features. It selects the best feature to split the data at each internal node based on certain criteria, such as information gain or Gini impurity. The goal is to create homogeneous subsets of data that are as pure as possible in terms of the target variable.

Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical features and can automatically handle missing values and feature interactions.
