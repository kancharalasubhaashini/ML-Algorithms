Linear Regression is an algorithm that belongs to supervised Machine Learning. It tries to apply relations that will predict the outcome of an event based on the independent variable data points. The relation is usually a straight line that best fits the different data points as close as possible. The output is of a continuous form, i.e., numerical value.
